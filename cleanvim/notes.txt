Several things that i need to do in order to make this configurations work (for my ubuntu 22.04 wsl)
- use wslu to open links in browser


TODO
- snacks pickers - choose layout 
(i only picked presets that are unique in sizes, the ones where the location is changed is skipped, for example if i choose right, i will not use Sidebar/Left)
    - NOTE: using previw = main, these are equal:
    - Presets with ! means it is different in position but equal in component sizes
        - dropdown, vertical
        - ivy, ivy_split, bottom
        - !right, sidebar
        - !select, vscode
        - telescope
        - default
        - top (no preview) - will not be used

    - Everything else use dropdown (default)- used when results list is very important
    - Right (Sidebar/Left is ditched) - when both preview and results are important
        - keymaps
    - Select - when preview is not important at all
    - Ivy - used when preview is very important
